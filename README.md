# PunxNotDead.Net

This is a simple HTML page that serves as a tribute to PunxNotDead.Net, a (mostly) monthly e-zine dedicated to punk music and culture from the late 1990s to 2001. The website connected like-minded individuals, shared music reviews, and promoted the spirit of punk. Though the original site no longer exists, this page honors its legacy.

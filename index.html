            Back in the late 1990s, when the internet was still a burgeoning frontier of creativity and opportunity, a young high school punk stumbled upon NameZero.com, a service offering free .net domain registrations. For someone working a minimum wage job to support a punk rock lifestyle, this was a huge deal—domain names were typically quite expensive and beyond what I could afford. So, I eagerly took the plunge and registered punxnotdead.net, not knowing this would mark the start of an unforgettable chapter in my life.

            The allure of creating a corner of the web dedicated to my greatest passions—punk music and culture—was irresistible. PunxNotDead.Net quickly evolved into a (mostly) monthly e-zine, a digital sanctuary where I could share my thoughts, interview bands, and post music reviews. Despite being a high school kid with limited resources, the website became a vibrant hub for like-minded individuals who shared a love for punk's unbridled spirit and ethos.

            Those years were filled with countless hours spent connecting with other punks around the country and the world through AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, ICQ, IRC, and email. The relationships forged through these conversations were invaluable, injecting my life with new ideas and experiences, all sparked by running this zine.

            In 2001, when NameZero.com went out of business, PunxNotDead.Net ceased to exist. However, its essence lived on through <a href="https://pndnrecords.com">PNDN Records</a>, a DIY venture that delved into music distribution, show booking, and promotion for local and touring bands. While PNDN Records was short-lived, the spirit of PunxNotDead.Net carried through, echoing the DIY ethos of punk culture in every endeavor.

            Though PunxNotDead.Net has been largely lost to time, the memories and influence it had on my path are timeless. It was not just a website—it was a lifestyle and a community that fueled my love for punk music and paved the way for creative pursuits I continue to cherish today. While all that seems to remain these days is <a href="archives/index.html">a few snapshots from the Wayback Machine</a>, this page now stands as a reminder of what once was.
